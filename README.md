# AIML3403 Capstone Project ‚Äì AI-Powered Fake Job Posting Detector
Capstone project for AIML-3403: AI-Powered Fake Job Posting Detector (Fall 2025)

## üìñ Project Overview
This project is part of **AIML-3403 (Capstone Project)** at Lambton College, Fall 2025.  
Our goal is to develop an **AI-powered system to detect fraudulent job postings** using **machine learning and natural language processing (NLP)** techniques.  

Fraudulent job ads are a growing concern in Canada, especially for **international students, newcomers, and young professionals**.  
Our system analyzes **job descriptions and metadata** (email domains, URLs, salary ranges, etc.) to classify postings as **real or fake**, and provides **explainability outputs** highlighting red-flag features.

## üéØ Objectives
- Detect fraudulent job postings using ML and NLP models.
- Compare **baseline models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) with **advanced models** (BERT/RoBERTa).
- Engineer **metadata-based features** and combine with NLP through a **fusion model**.
- Apply **explainable AI (SHAP/LIME)** to highlight fraud indicators.
- Build a **prototype app (Streamlit/Flask)** to demonstrate real-time fraud detection.
